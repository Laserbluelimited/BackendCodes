      <h1>Low Cost Taxi & Private Hire Medicals</h1>
      <p class="text-break fw-bold mt-5">Taxi and Private Hire drivers must pass a taxi driver medical assessment before they receive a licence to operate.</p>
      <p class="text-break mt-5 mb-5">We have been approved by a number of councils to provide taxi medicals across the UK. Most councils require doctors
      to have access to your full medical records in order to determine whether you meet the current group 2 DVLA standards. It is essential 
      that your doctor has your full medical history in order to conduct a thorough medical assessment and determine your fitness to drive.</p>
      <p class="text-break">Depending on your councils requirements we might be unable to carry out your taxi medical if you fail to provide
      your full medical history on the day of your appointment.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="range-texts mt-5">
    <h2 class="mb-5">What you need to bring to the medical?</h2>
    <ul class="pb-3">
      <li class="mt-3">Taxi Medical Form</li>
      <li class="mt-3">Driving license or passport</li>
      <li class="mt-3">Proof of Address (Bank Statement or Utility Bill)</li>
      <li class="mt-3">Driving glasses and recent prescription from optician</li>
      <li class="mt-3">List of current medication including dose and start date</li>
      <li class="mt-3">Any relevant hospital notes and discharge summaries</li>
      <li class="mt-3">Full Medical Records - Required by most Councils (Anyone can request from their GP)</li>
    </ul>
      <h2 class="mt-5">What will happen at the medical?</h2>
      <p class="text-break mt-5 fw-bold">Our doctors will confirm your identity and conduct a full D4 medical during your appointment.</p>
      <p class="text-break mt-5">Taxi driver medicals will include a thorough medical history and an assessment of your physical health. The doctor will take a blood pressure reading which complies with DVLA criteria and conduct a visual acuity test using a DVLA approved Snellen chart.</p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">What to do after the medical?</h2>
      <p class="text-break mt-5">Please submit your completed application forms to your council. Kindly refer to your councils website for information on how to submit your application.</p>
