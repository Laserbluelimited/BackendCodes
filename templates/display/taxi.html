                <p class="text-break">We have been approved by a number of councils to provide taxi medicals across the UK. Most councils require doctors
                to have access to your full medical records in order to determine whether you meet the current group 2 DVLA standards. It is essential 
                that your doctor has your full medical history in order to conduct a thorough medical assessment and determine your fitness to drive.</p>
                <p class="text-break">Depending on your councils requirements we might be unable to carry out your taxi medical if you fail to provide
                your full medical history on the day of your appointment.</p>
